### Wine Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict the quality of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine based on its physicochemical properties. The dataset used in this project is the "Wine Quality" dataset, which is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Dataset Description
The "Wine Quality" dataset consists of 11 input variables and 1 output variable. The input variables include physicochemical properties such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content. The output variable is the quality of the wine, which is a score between 0 and 10. The dataset contains 1599 samples of wine.

### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of the wine based on its physicochemical properties. This model can be used by winemakers to quickly assess the quality of their wine and make improvements as needed.

### Approach
In this project, we will be using a supervised learning approach to train a machine learning model. We will be using the scikit-learn library in Python to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
