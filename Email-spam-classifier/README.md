## Email Spam Detector
This project aims to build an email spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques. We will use logistic regression to train our spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam categories. The dataset used in this project is available at https://github.com/SmallLion/Python-Projects/blob/main/Spam-detection/spam.csv.

### Overview
Spam emails, also known as junk mails, are unsolicited and unwanted messages sent in bulk to users. These messages can contain scams, phishing content, or malware, which may expose your computer and personal information to potential risks. While most email platforms automatically filter spam emails, some well-disguised spam emails can still end up in your inbox. In this project, we will be developing a machine learning model to detect spam emails more accurately.

### Model
We will use logistic regression, a type of supervised learning algorithm, to train our spam detector. Logistic regression is a good choice for this problem since it works well with binary classification tasks, such as classifying emails as spam or non-spam.

### Evaluation
The model's performance will be evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics will help us understand how well our model can correctly identify spam emails and separate them from legitimate ones.
